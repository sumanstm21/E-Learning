<h2>WHAT IS A DATABASE?</h2>
A database is a set of data stored in a computer. This data is usually structured in a way that makes the data easily accessible.

WHAT IS A RELATIONAL DATABASE?
A relational database is a type of database. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.

TABLES: ROWS AND COLUMNS
Tables can have hundreds, thousands, sometimes even millions of rows of data. These rows are often called records.

Tables can also have many columns of data. Columns are labeled with a descriptive name (say, age for example) and have a specific data type.

For example, a column called age may have a type of INTEGER (denoting the type of data it is meant to hold).
